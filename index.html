 Many janapadas grew up along the old Bhagirathi channel from the ancient times till around the 16th century: Kalighat, Boral, Rajpur, Harinavi, Mahinagar, Baruipur, Baharu, Jaynagar, Majilpur, Chhatrabhog etc.   Bipradas Pipilai's Manasavijaya, composed in 1495, mentions many places in this region.<em> chan sadagar</em> "Chand Sadagar, a merchant character of the Manasavijaya, reached Baruipur, from Kalighat, through the old Bhagirathi channel. From there he proceeded towards Chhatrabhog, and then traveling through Hatiagarh pargana reached the open sea". Chaitanyadeva (1486â€“1534) also went through this route. Travelling by boat to Puri he halted at the village of Atisara, near Baruipur. <br>"His last stoppage in 24 Parganas was at Chhatrabhog, now a village within the jurisdiction of the Mathurapur police stationChhatrabhog seems to have been an important river-port on the old Bhagirathi channel".Rama Chandra Khan, the zamindar of Chhatrabhog, helped Chaitanyadeva to continue with his journey.
